### New Relic Infrastructure monitoring Agent - Amazon EC2 Integration on AWS

New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards EC2 metadata from our on-host integrations to New Relic products, as well as log data for log analytics.

After you install the New Relic infrastructure agent on each EC2 instance, you can view metrics from that instance and get a comprehensive, real-time view of the performance and status of your EC2 instances.

Refer [this](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/) document for more information.
