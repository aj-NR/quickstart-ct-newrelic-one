## Costs

You are responsible for the cost of running the AWS services created by cloudformation template and any third-party licenses used while running this guidance template. There is no additional cost for using the automation template.

By customizing the EC2 instance type, it is possible to optimize costs.

For cost estimates, see the pricing pages for each AWS service created using template. Prices are subject to change.

### Post-Deployment

Note: After you deploy the template, create [AWS Cost and Usage Reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/cur-create.html) to deliver billing metrics to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in your account. These reports provide cost estimates based on usage throughout each month and aggregate the data at the end of the month. For more information, see [What are AWS Cost and Usage Reports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html)?
