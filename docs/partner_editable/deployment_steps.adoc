## Deployment Steps

1. Before proceeding with the deployment, please review the prerequisites section.
2. Access the AWS CloudFormation resource and navigate to the designer to create a new stack. Utilize the EC2 guidance template provided here to generate the necessary resources.
3. When creating the stack, ensure to provide a meaningful name and fill in all the requested parameters. For further details, refer to the input_parameters section. Please keep in mind the parameter constraints and descriptions.
4. Wait for the deployment process to complete.
5. Once the deployment is finished, you can monitor the installation status in the New Relic account logs. 
    * Note that if you specify an EC2 tag, the new relic agent will only be installed on instances that have that specific key-value pair tag. 
    * Additionally, the agent will be installed one time on deployment, everytime when instances transition to the "running" state and all instances will get updated with the latest New Relic agent once a month.
6. In case of any issues, please consult the support and troubleshooting section for assistance.
